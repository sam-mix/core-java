我们在学校学的数学并不是数学的全部
The mathematics we learn in school doesn’t quite do the field of mathematics justice.
我们仅窥视到它的一角 整体来说
We only get a glimpse at one corner of it, but the mathematics as a whole is a huge and
数学是一个庞大且分支众多的学科
wonderfully diverse subject.
我做这个视频的目的是给你展示所有不可思议的东西
My aim with this video is to show you all that amazing stuff.
我们退回到一开始
We’ll start back at the very beginning.
数学起源于计数
The origin of mathematics lies in counting.
事实上 计数并不是人类所独有的能力 其它动物也会计数
In fact counting is not just a human trait, other animals are able to count as well and
证明人类计数的证据能追溯到史前时期
evidence for human counting goes back to prehistoric times with check marks
用骨头做的记号
made in bones.
这些年来 世界经历了几次大进步 埃及人首先发明了方程式
There were several innovations over the years with the Egyptians having the first equation,
古希腊人在众多领域取得了长足的进步像几何学 命理学
the ancient Greeks made strides in many areas like geometry and numerology, and
而负数则在中国被创造出来
negative numbers were invented in China.
零作为一个数字首先在印度被使用
And zero as a number was first used in India.
然后在伊斯兰教的黄金时代 波斯数学家取得了更大的进步
Then in the Golden Age of Islam Persian mathematicians made further strides and
于是 第一本关于代数学的书诞生了
the first book on algebra was written.
随着科学的发展 数学在文艺复兴时期蓬勃发展
Then mathematics boomed in the renaissance along with the sciences.
像我刚才说的关于数学的历史还有很多
Now there is a lot more to the history of mathematics then what I have just said, but
但是我要跳到我们所熟知的现代数学
I’m gonna jump to the modern age and mathematics as we know it now.
现代数学大体上可以被分为两个部分 纯数学:
Modern mathematics can be broadly be broken down into two areas, pure maths: the study
只为数学本身发展而进行的研究 应用数学：通过发展数学
of mathematics for its own sake, and applied maths: when you develop mathematics to help
去帮助解决一些现实的社会问题
solve some real world problem.
但是有很多交叉
But there is a lot of crossover.
事实上 历史上很多次研究者走进数学的荒地
In fact, many times in history someone’s gone off into the mathematical wilderness
纯粹是出于好奇心和某种美感的引导
motivated purely by curiosity and kind of guided by a sense of aesthetics.
然后 他们就创造了一整个新的既精密又有趣的数学天地
And then they have created a whole bunch of new mathematics which was nice and interesting
但是却没有真正做任何对现实有用的事情
but doesn’t really do anything useful.
但是一百年后有人会在物理或计算机科学的
But then, say a hundred years later, someone will be working on some problem at the cutting
前沿研究一些问题 他们会发现纯粹数学中的旧理论
edge of physics or computer science and they’ll discover that this old theory in pure maths
正是他们解决现实世界问题所需要的！
is exactly what they need to solve their real world problems!
我觉得这真是太神奇啦！
Which is amazing, I think!
而这样的事情已经在过去几个世纪里发生过很多次了
And this kind of thing has happened so many times over the last few centuries.
非常有趣的是 如此抽象的概念最终总是会变得很有用
It is interesting how often something so abstract ends up being really useful.
但我还要指出的是 纯数学本身仍然是一件很有价值的事情
But I should also mention, pure mathematics on its own is still a very valuable thing to do
因为它可以令人陶醉 而它本身就带有一种美和高雅
because it can be fascinating and on its own can have a real beauty and elegance
这几乎和艺术相当
that almost becomes like art.
好的 歌颂数学就告一段落了 我们走进它吧
Okay enough of this highfalutin, lets get into it.
纯数学由几个部分组成
Pure maths is made of several sections.
关于数字的学习 由自然数开始 之后 你学会的
The study of numbers starts with the natural numbers and what you can do with them is
便是算数
arithmetic operations.
然后数学接受了其他种类的数如整数 包括负数
And then it looks at other kinds of numbers like integers, which contain negative numbers,
有理数像分数 包括 π 在内的具有无穷小数的实数
rational numbers like fractions, real numbers which include numbers like pi which go off
然后是复数和一大堆其他数
to infinite decimal points, and then complex numbers and a whole bunch of others.
有的数字的性质很有趣如质数 π 或指数
Some numbers have interesting properties like Prime Numbers, or pi or the exponential.
而这些数字系统也有各自的性质比如 尽管整数和实数
There are also properties of these number systems, for example, even though there is
都是无穷的 但实数的数量还是
an infinite amount of both integers and real numbers, there are more real numbers than
比整数多
integers.
因此有些无穷大的量要比别的大
So some infinities are bigger than others.
对结构的研究就是你开始将数字代入变量形式的
The study of structures is where you start taking numbers and putting them into equations
方程中
in the form of variables.
代数学包含了你如何处理这些方程的规则
Algebra contains the rules of how you then manipulate these equations.
在这儿你还会发现向量和矩阵 这些多维数
Here you will also find vectors and matrices which are multi-dimensional numbers, and the
以及关于他们之间关系的规则都会包含在线性代数里
rules of how they relate to each other are captured in linear algebra.
数论在最后一节中研究了所有数字的特征 如素数
Number theory studies the features of everything in the last section on numbers like the properties
的性质
of prime numbers.
组合数学研究的是某些特定结构的性质例如树 属性图和一些其他
Combinatorics looks at the properties of certain structures like trees, graphs, and other things
可以计算的离散块
that are made of discreet chunks that you can count.
群论研究的是在群组中相互关联的对象
Group theory looks at objects that are related to each other in, well, groups.
常见的一个例子是魔方 它是置换群的一个例子
A familiar example is a Rubik’s cube which is an example of a permutation group.
而序论研究如何按照某些规则来排列对象 比如什么
And order theory investigates how to arrange objects following certain rules like, how
数比其他数更大
something is a larger quantity than something else.
自然数集是有序集的一个例子 即在一定规则下 任意两边之间的
The natural numbers are an example of an ordered set of objects, but anything with any two
关系都可以对应
way relationship can be ordered.
另一部分纯数学关注的是空间中的形状及其运动轨迹
Another part of pure mathematics looks at shapes and how they behave in spaces.
它起源于几何学 包括毕达格拉斯定理 它和三角法则相近
The origin is in geometry which includes Pythagoras, and is close to trigonometry, which we are
就是我们在学校里很熟悉的那个法则
all familiar with from school.
这儿也有有趣的课程 比如分形几何学 这是缩放不变性的数学模型
Also there are fun things like fractal geometry which are mathematical patterns which are
这意味着你可以永远放大它 它们看起来
scale invariant, which means you can zoom into them forever and they always look kind
总是一样的
of the same.
拓扑学研究空间的不同属性允许连续变形
Topology looks at different properties of spaces where you are allowed to continuously
但不撕裂或粘合它们
deform them but not tear or glue them.
例如 不管怎么做 莫比乌斯带都只能得到一个面和一条边
For example a Möbius strip has only one surface and one edge whatever you do to it.
从拓扑学的角度来说 咖啡杯和甜甜圈是一样的
And coffee cups and donuts are the same thing – topologically speaking.
测度论是一种给空间或者数和空间赋值
Measure theory is a way to assign values to spaces or sets tying together numbers and
的集合
spaces.
最后 微分几何研究的是曲面图形的性质
And finally, differential geometry looks the properties of shapes on curved surfaces, for
例如三角形在曲面上具有不同的角度 这就是下一节
example triangles have got different angles on a curved surface, and brings us to the
要讲的变化
next section, which is changes.
对变化的研究包含微积分 它涉及微积分
The study of changes contains calculus which involves integrals and differentials which
主要研究函数所跨越的区域或函数梯度的行为
looks at area spanned out by functions or the behaviour of gradients of functions.
向量计算也研究向量相同的东西
And vector calculus looks at the same things for vectors.
我们还发现了其他领域如动力系统 随着
Here we also find a bunch of other areas like dynamical systems which looks at systems that
时间的变化 它研究了从一种状态到另一种状态的系统 像流体流动或类似生态系统
evolve in time from one state to another, like fluid flows or things with feedback loops
的反馈循环
like ecosystems.
混沌理论是研究对初始条件非常敏感的动力系统的理论
And chaos theory which studies dynamical systems that are very sensitive to initial conditions.
最后复变函数考察了复数的函数性质
Finally complex analysis looks at the properties of functions with complex numbers.
这就带来了应用数学
This brings us to applied mathematics.
这里值得一提的是 这里的一切都比我画的更
At this point it is worth mentioning that everything here is a lot more interrelated
有关联
than I have drawn.
事实上 这张地图看起来更像一张网将所有不同的主题捆绑在一起
In reality this map should look like more of a web tying together all the different
但你只能在二维平面上做这么多所以我尽可能
subjects but you can only do so much on a two dimensional plane so I have laid them
地把它们画出来
out as best I can.
好的 我们从数学物理学开始 在某种程度上运用了
Okay we’ll start with physics, which uses just about everything on the left hand side
左边的一切
to some degree.
数学和理论物理学在纯数学上有着非常密切的关系
Mathematical and theoretical physics has a very close relationship with pure maths.
数学也用在数学化学和生物数学建模等其他自然科学
Mathematics is also used in the other natural sciences with mathematical chemistry and biomathematics
主要研究从分子模型到生物进化学的大量原材料
which look at loads of stuff from modelling molecules to evolutionary biology.
数学在工程学中也被广泛使用 自从埃及和巴比伦时代以来
Mathematics is also used extensively in engineering, building things has taken a lot of maths since
建筑工程已经进行了大量的数学研究
Egyptian and Babylonian times.
例如飞机这样非常复杂的电力系统或称为控制理论的动力系统中的
Very complex electrical systems like aeroplanes or the power grid use methods in dynamical
电网使用方法
systems called control theory.
数值分析是一种数学工具常用于数学计算太复杂而
Numerical analysis is a mathematical tool commonly used in places where the mathematics
不能完全解决的地方
becomes too complex to solve completely.
因此 你可以使用大量简单的近似值 并将它们结合在一起 可以得到
So instead you use lots of simple approximations and combine them all together to get good
近似的答案
approximate answers.
例如 如果你将一个圆圈放在正方形内 并向里面投掷飞镖 然后比较圆圈和方
For example if you put a circle inside a square, throw darts at it, and then compare the number
形部分中的飞镖数量 可以得到近似 π 的值
of darts in the circle and square portions, you can approximate the value of pi.
但在现实世界中 数值分析是在巨型计算机上完成的
But in the real world numerical analysis is done on huge computers.
博弈论着眼于给出一系列规则和理性球员的最佳选择
Game theory looks at what the best choices are given a set of rules and rational players
常用于经济学中玩家比较智能的情况但并非总是如此 有时也用于其他
and it’s used in economics when the players can be intelligent, but not always, and other
领域 如心理学和生物学
areas like psychology, and biology.
概率是研究随机事件的像掷硬币 骰子或人
Probability is the study of random events like coin tosses or dice or humans, and statistics
统计学是对大量的随机过程或数据的组织和分析
is the study of large collections of random processes or the organisation and analysis
的研究
of data.
这显然与金融数学有关 你要模拟金融系统
This is obviously related to mathematical finance, where you want model financial systems
并争取赢得所有这些快栈
and get an edge to win all those fat stacks.
与此相关的是优化 当你计算出最佳的选择之间的一组不同的选项或限制
Related to this is optimisation, where you are trying to calculate the best choice amongst
你通常可以设想一下 试着
a set of many different options or constraints, which you can normally visualise as trying
找出函数的最高点和最低点
to find the highest or lowest point of a function.
最优化问题对我们人类来说是第二天性我们总是这样做：试图
Optimisation problems are second nature to us humans, we do them all the time: trying
获得最大的金钱价值 或者试图以某种方式使我们的幸福最大化
to get the best value for money, or trying to maximise our happiness in some way.
与纯数学密切相关的另一个领域是计算机科学
Another area that is very deeply related to pure mathematics is computer science, and
计算机科学的规则实际上是从纯数学中衍生出来的
the rules of computer science were actually derived in pure maths and is another example
是在可编程计算机出现之前的另一个例子
of something that was worked out way before programmable computers were built.
机器学习：智能计算机系统的创建可用于数学中的许多领域
Machine learning: the creation of intelligent computer systems uses many areas in mathematics
如线性代数 最优化 动力系统和概率
like linear algebra, optimisation, dynamical systems and probability.
最后计算对密码学的理论非常重要 使用了大量的
And finally the theory of cryptography is very important to computation and uses a lot
纯数学 组合数学和数论
of pure maths like combinatorics and number theory.
因此 它涵盖了纯数学和应用数学的主要部分
So that covers the main sections of pure and applied mathematics, but I can’t end without
但是我不能不研究数学基础就结束
looking at the foundations of mathematics.
这个领域试图研究数学本身的特性并问
This area tries to work out at the properties of mathematics itself, and asks what the basis
所有数学规则的依据是什么
of all the rules of mathematics is.
是否有一套完整的基本规则称之为公理化的东西
Is there a complete set of fundamental rules, called axioms, which all of mathematics comes
而所有数学都来源于此？
from?
我们能证明它本身的一致性吗？
And can we prove that it is all consistent with itself?
数理逻辑 集合论 范畴论都设法解答这个问题 数理逻辑中
Mathematical logic, set theory and category theory try to answer this and a famous result
的哥德尔不完全性定理是这一问题的著名结论 即对大多数人来说
in mathematical logic are Gödel’s incompleteness theorems which, for most people, means that
这意味着数学没有一套完整一致的公理说明它都是由我们人类
Mathematics does not have a complete and consistent set of axioms, which mean that it is all kinda
组成的
made up by us humans.
这是很奇怪的 因为数学在宇宙中解释了这么多的东西
Which is weird seeing as mathematics explains so much stuff in the Universe so well.
为什么人类制造的东西能够做到这一点呢？
Why would a thing made up by humans be able to do that?
这是很深的奥秘吧
That is a deep mystery right there.
我们也有计算理论 它着眼于不同的计算模型以及
Also we have the theory of computation which looks at different models of computing and
他们如何有效地解决问题计算理论包括复杂性理论
how efficiently they can solve problems and contains complexity theory which looks at
这些理论关注的是什么以及你需要多少内存和时间是不能计算的 这对于
what is and isn’t computable and how much memory and time you would need, which, for
大多数有趣的问题来说都是一个巨大的数据
most interesting problems, is an insane amount.
这就是数学地图
Ending So that is the map of mathematics.
现在我最喜欢学习数学的一点是 你感觉到一个似乎
Now the thing I have loved most about learning maths is that feeling you get where something
令人困惑的东西 最后不断敲击你的大脑然后豁然开朗：
that seemed so confusing finally clicks in your brain and everything makes sense: like
就像顿悟的瞬间 有点像看透矩阵
an epiphany moment, kind of like seeing through the matrix.
事实上 我觉得我最聪明的时候是对数学的某些部分
In fact some of my most satisfying intellectual moments have been understanding some part
理解了 然后我觉得我对宇宙的基本性质
of mathematics and then feeling like I had a glimpse at the fundamental nature of the
所有神奇的对称有了一个全面的了解
Universe in all of its symmetrical wonder.
很好 我喜欢它
It’s great, I love it.
应广大要求 我结束了数学地图的制作
Ending Making a map of mathematics was the most popular
我非常开心 因为我喜欢数学 并且数学中
request I got, which I was really happy about because I love maths and its great to see
有这么多有趣的东西
so much interest in it.
我希望你们会喜欢
So I hope you enjoyed it.
显然 在这个时间段我只能做这么多 但希望我的讲解
Obviously there is only so much I can get into this timeframe, but hopefully I have
切合主题 并对你有用
done the subject justice and you found it useful.
所以很快我还会出更多的视频这都是有规律的东西
So there will be more videos coming from me soon, here’s all the regular things and
我很高兴下次再见
it was my pleasure see you next time.
